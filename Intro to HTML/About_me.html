        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <P>We had the best dog ever when we were kids. He had incredible comedic timing and was the funniest man alive. He was half English Bulldog. But he didn't appear to be an English bully at all. At the height of pitbull phobia in the 1990s, he appeared to be one. He was enthralled by wheels, just like many Bulldogs. He like attacking large wheels, skateboard wheels, etc. He particularly enjoyed it when the UPS truck would pass by our block. He eventually began to anticipate it approaching and stand at the window as it approached. He once exited and tried to catch a truck, but we managed to catch him first. The UPS truck served as both his passion and his foe for ten years. Anywayâ€¦</P>
